excerpt: I am fortunate to be a member of Northwestern's varsity cross country team. I love my team with all my heart. Here's an overview of what it's like to be part of NUXC ðŸ’œ

Above is a picture of some of my teammates and I in the middle of a tempo run along Lake Michigan on a beautiful fall day. It's moments like this that bring our team together; getting comfortable with being uncomfortable and running in a pack as we work towards a common goal.

Much of my life and lifestyle revolves around running, but I wouldn't want to have it any other way. I run anywhere from 45 to 70 miles a week, however, I have recently enjoyed becoming a *high mileage gal*, hovering around 60+ miles per week.

After Northwestern, I am excited to continue running, whether that means trail running, marathon training, just running for fun to find/build a community in a new place, or all of the above.
